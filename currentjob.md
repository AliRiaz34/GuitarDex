deviating a bit from roadmap. 

i want to focus on setting up what html templates im going to use.





## IMPLEMENTATIONS TO REMEMBER
fix, when do song go from learnt to stale and mastered






consider having a decay table to keep track

have sort menu in library

question mark in searchbar blinks

selection highlight when hovering a entry in lib

long text needs to wrap!!!

fix navbar ui
-make it so clicking on page icon youre on it dosent refetch page, just shows default

library is scrollable

PRACTICE PAGE!!!!


### long term IDEAS

have a main 10 song roster, team
have playlists
find api to find song cover, or give user option to upload
have a settings page (gotta figure out what)

if theres been level up, and you revisit song page, then have animation

add options menu in song view
