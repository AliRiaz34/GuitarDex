deviating a bit from roadmap. 

i want to focus on setting up what html templates im going to use.



## IMPLEMENTATIONS TO REMEMBER
fix, when do song go from learnt to stale and mastered

consider having a decay table to keep track

# have sort menu in library



fix navbar ui
-make it so clicking on page icon youre on it dosent refetch page, just shows default

library is scrollable

PRACTICE PAGE!!!!

MAKE EVERYTHING TO IPHONE SCALE

### long term IDEAS
question mark in searchbar blinks

animation when js page changes

have a main 10 song roster, team
have playlists
find api to find song cover, or give user option to upload
have a settings page (gotta figure out what)

if theres been level up, and you revisit song page, then have animation

add options menu in song view
