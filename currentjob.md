deviating a bit from roadmap. 

i want to focus on setting up what html templates im going to use. not gonna focus on looks, just want elements and fuctionality im gonna have.





## IMPLEMENTATIONS TO REMEMBER
fix, when do song go from learnt to stale, decide if mastered songs can go stale?
how much xp to level in song view
what is xp threshold ( 54/?)


### long term IDEAS

have a main 10 song roster, team
have playlists
find api to find song cover, or give user option to upload
