deviating a bit from roadmap. 

i want to focus on setting up what html templates im going to use. not gonna focus on looks, just want elements and fuctionality im gonna have.

#### start with a main my library page.






## IMPLEMENTATIONS TO REMEMBER
fix, only first practice shows the song duration field

fix, when do song go from learnt to stale, decide if mastered songs can go stale?



### long term IDEAS

have a main 10 song roster, team
have playlists
find api to find song cover, or give user option to upload
search bar in library
