im curious as to how the website should be structured with templates. lets start simple, just to test functionality i guess. 



we have one front page that displays all songs. im going to start with no user system, just to get very very basic stuff setup. 

so first required function is to add new songs. 



lets start with sql query to add new song - ok done



now app.py route setup

it seems in tunescore i had a editor page for score editing. 

as guitardex isnt based around a post that needs editing more data to keep track of. it seems to make more sense to just have a new song page. with fields to submit.
