deviating a bit from roadmap. 

## IMPLEMENTATIONS TO REMEMBER

fix navbar ui

MAKE EVERYTHING TO IPHONE SCALE
- dark mode
- library is scrollable

have playlists



MAKE ALBUM LIKE GYM, WHICH GYM BADGE!


### long term IDEAS

# convert to SPA


be able to pin song in library

animations
- animation when js view changes
- if theres been level up, and you revisit song page, then have animation


have a main 10 song roster, team


have multiuser playlists with a table to show each users level
          User 1      User 2
Song 1    Lv            Lv
Song 2    Lv            Lv
Song 3    Lv            Lv
Song 4    Lv            Lv



have a settings page (gotta figure out what)

add options menu in song view
