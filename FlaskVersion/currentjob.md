deviating a bit from roadmap. 

## IMPLEMENTATIONS TO REMEMBER


have playlists

timer in practice page

# CSS for mobile  <-- current
MAKE EVERYTHING TO IPHONE SCALE
- dark mode
- library has scrollwheel
- you can go to next song in song view

MAKE ALBUM LIKE GYM, WHICH GYM BADGE!

show ... when too long
when mastered but unpracticed dont show duration

validate name and artist being empty

### long term IDEAS

be able to pin song in library

animations
- animation when js view changes
- if theres been level up, and you revisit song page, then have animation


have a main 10 song roster, team


have multiuser playlists with a table to show each users level
          User 1      User 2
Song 1    Lv            Lv
Song 2    Lv            Lv
Song 3    Lv            Lv
Song 4    Lv            Lv



have a settings page (gotta figure out what)

add options menu in song view
- be able to edit and delete
